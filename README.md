# National Forest Project

The analysis and the data on this page were used to publish a USA Today Network project exploring special use permits for systems that divert or transport water on national forest land. 

# About the ipynb files

<b>Forest Check:</b> confirms that permits or easements exist in every continental National Forest admin area

<b>Final copy of analysis based on NF acreage:</b> Analysis on Forest to Faucet data to determine net change in runoff volume within the boundaries of national forests

<b>Permit_data_master_FS:</b> This code created from the original FOIA response the master permit file used in the searchable database, and for analysis of permits / easements within each forest

# About the data files
<b>original water use file.xslx:</b> Data in its original form sent to us from the National Forest Service, in response to our FOIA. 

<b>cb_2018_us_state_20m.zip:</b> Shapefile of state boundaries from the census

Forest Service researchers determined percent change using a climate model with a relatively ‘wet’ scenario. The researchers projected change based on a future with relatively low carbon emissions, and one with unlikely and extremely high emissions.

Climate scientists typically use models to compare how the climate is likely to change under different amounts of environmental interventions. The Republic is showing the low-emissions model, which is considered to be fairly optimistic.

The Republic's watershed map reflects only one potential future and predicting precipitation comes with a lot of uncertainty.
